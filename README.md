QuDOS: Quantum Dynamics of Open Systems
=====

As it says above this package is intended to provide types and
functionality to explore the quantum dynamics of open systems in Julia.
This is pretty much work in progress, so any comments and/or
PRs are very welcome.

Some examples can be found in the directory `examples/`.
